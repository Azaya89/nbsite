**Build a tested, sphinx-based website from notebooks**

Note: this is a work in progress!

Sites built using nbsite (currently so I can keep track;
eventually trim to a few examples):
  
  * `<http://holoviews.org/>`_ (`holoviews
    <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews>`_; note: built with a
    more advanced prototype of nbsite)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/parambokeh>`_ (`parambokeh
    <https://github.com/ioam/parambokeh>`_)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/geoviews>`_ (`geoviews
    <https://github.com/ioam/geoviews>`_)
    
  * `<https://ceball.github.io/datashader/>`_ (a tmp fork of
    `datashader <https://github.com/ceball/datashader/>`_)
    
  * `<https://continuumio.github.io/anacondaviz>`_ (`anacondaviz
    <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anacondaviz>`_)

  * `<https://ceball.github.io/>`_ (`tmp demo site
    <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/tmphvdocs/tree/tmphvdocs>`_; note:
    built from scratch, starting from nbsite template)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/nbsite>`_ (`nbsite
    <https://github.com/ioam/nbsite>`_; note: this site ;) )
