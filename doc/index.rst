**Build a tested, sphinx-based website from notebooks**

Note: this is a work in progress!

Sites built using nbsite (currently so I can keep track;
eventually trim to a few examples):
  
  * `<http://holoviews.org/>`_ (`holoviews
    <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews>`_; note: built with a
    more advanced prototype of nbsite)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/parambokeh/>`_ (`parambokeh
    <https://github.com/ioam/parambokeh>`_)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/geoviews/>`_ (`geoviews
    <https://github.com/ioam/geoviews>`_)
    
  * `<https://bokeh.github.io/datashader-docs/>`_ (`datashader
    <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader/>`_)
    
  * `<https://pyviz.github.io/pyviz/>`_ (`pyviz
    <https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz>`_)

  * `<https://ceball.github.io/>`_ (`tmp demo site
    <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/tmphvdocs/tree/tmphvdocs>`_; note:
    built from scratch, starting from nbsite template)

  * `<https://ioam.github.io/nbsite/>`_ (`nbsite
    <https://github.com/ioam/nbsite>`_; note: this site ;) )
    

Why (or why not) use this rater than : nikola; pelican; jupytersite;
hugo; (whatever
https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html uses),
whatever scikit-learn uses ; wahtever scikit-image uses; ...

Why not using: http://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.2.17/index.html, RunNotebook https://github.com/ngoldbaum/RunNotebook
