    "Things \"definitely work\" if:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * following all steps below\n",
    "  * wit hthe structure below\n",
    "  * for a holoviews/bokeh project\n",
    "  * on linux and mac\n",
    "  \n",
    "Things mmight work if you skip steps, with a different structure, or using other visualization stuff, or using windows. All untested, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want a 'static', fairly self contained site (i.e. just ordinary web server required, you can build and serve locally/copy build dir to server, and things will just work).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have one or more sets of notebooks (e.g. `examples/getting_started`, `examples/user_guide`, `examples/gallery`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (optional, for ref man) You have installed (e.g. `pip install -e /path/to/pkg`) the package for which you wish to generate reference manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to install\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (conda install nonexistent package) `conda install -c ioam -c bokeh -c conda-forge -c defaults python=3.6* paramnb numpy scipy notebook matplotlib pandas bokeh=0.12.10 nose networkx xarray datashader scikit-image selenium phantomjs streamz=0.2.0 dask=0.15.4 sphinx runipy beautifulsoup4 graphviz plotly holoviews`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pip install nbsite && pip install sphinx_ioam_theme`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"One time\" setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can skip various steps below depending on what you already have. But if you skip a step, you may need to add something to a file (should be able to figure that out by looking at the template file).\n",
    "\n",
    "0. `export MODULE=yourmodule`, `export PROJECT=yourproject` (or just replace as appropriate in commands below)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a doc dir: `mkdir doc && cd doc`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a set of basic pages: `nbsite_from_tmplate.py .` (will not overwrite existing files)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Edit conf.py\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Edit doc/index.rst toctree to match pages in conf.py\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Edit/delete other pages as desired, or add pages. (might want to grep for 'project' and 'holoviews'...)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit initial version of your pages  `git commit -m \"something\" FAQ.rst Makefile about.rst conf.py index.rst latest_news.html ...` (etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building site whenever\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (optional, if you want ref manual) Generate reference manual pages: `nbsite_generate_modules.py ${MODULE} -d ./Reference_Manual -n ${PROJECT} -e tests` (TODO: commit or not...I reckon not)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate rst containers for notebooks: `nbsite_nbpagebuild.py ${PROJECT} ../examples .`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (optional, if you want gallery) Make gallery: `nbsite_gallery.py ../`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make site: `sphinx-build -b html . ./_build/html`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. (TODO: go look at the travis file to copy the find/move commands)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Update cross-notebook links for html: `nbsite_fix_links.py _build/html`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. View the result in a browser at localhost:8000: `pushd _build/html && python -m http.server`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deploy to gh pages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `touch ./_build/html/.nojekyll`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Something like this into `.travis.yml` (but modify for your own preferences):\n",
